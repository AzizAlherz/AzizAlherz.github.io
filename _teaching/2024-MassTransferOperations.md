### Course Description
This course covers a broad range of mass transfer operations essential to chemical engineering. A solid understanding of Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics is crucial for comprehending the material. The course focuses on practical problem-solving through the application of **Numerical Methods and Excel-based solutions**. The ultimate goal is to equip students with the skills to model and design units for various separation processes.

### Student Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Understand the fundamental principles of various mass transfer operations, including distillation, absorption, extraction, and others.
* Apply numerical methods and spreadsheet-based tools to solve complex mass transfer problems.
* Model and design separation units commonly used in the chemical industry.

### Required Textbook
* *Transport Processes & Separation Process Principles*, 5th edition, by C. Geankopolis, A. Hersel, and D. Lepek.

### Course Topics
The course covers the following major separation processes:
* Distillation
* Absorption/Stripping
* Liquid-Liquid Extraction
* Leaching
* Adsorption
* Membrane Separation Processes

### Grading Breakdown
* **Homework Assignments:** 5%
