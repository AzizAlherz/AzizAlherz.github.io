Thermodynamics is a cornerstone of chemical engineering, providing the essential tools to determine the feasibility of a process. The concepts covered are fundamental to subsequent courses such as kinetics, separations, mass transfer, and design. This course reviews the first and second laws of thermodynamics, with a primary emphasis on the **nonideal properties** of single-component and multicomponent systems. A major portion of the course is devoted to **phase equilibrium**, which is critical for separations like distillation and extraction, and **chemical equilibrium**, which is essential for reactor design.


### Course Description
Thermodynamics is a cornerstone of chemical engineering, providing the essential tools to determine the feasibility of a process. The concepts covered are fundamental to subsequent courses such as kinetics, separations, mass transfer, and design. This course reviews the first and second laws of thermodynamics, with a primary emphasis on the **nonideal properties** of single-component and multicomponent systems. A major portion of the course is devoted to **phase equilibrium**, which is critical for separations like distillation and extraction, and **chemical equilibrium**, which is essential for reactor design.

### Student Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
*  Define a thermodynamic system and solve problems using the first and second laws of thermodynamics.
*  Apply equations of state (EOS) to estimate the thermodynamic properties of real fluids using departure functions.
*  Distinguish the differences between an ideal gas, an ideal solution, and a non-ideal solution.
*  Calculate the equilibrium distribution of a component between multiple phases.
*  Calculate the maximum extent of chemical reactions.
*  Use simulation packages to design common equipment such as valves, compressors, and heat exchangers.
