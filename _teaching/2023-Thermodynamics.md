Thermodynamics is a cornerstone of chemical engineering, providing the essential tools to determine the feasibility of a process. The concepts covered are fundamental to subsequent courses such as kinetics, separations, mass transfer, and design. This course reviews the first and second laws of thermodynamics, with a primary emphasis on the **nonideal properties** of single-component and multicomponent systems. A major portion of the course is devoted to **phase equilibrium**, which is critical for separations like distillation and extraction, and **chemical equilibrium**, which is essential for reactor design.


### Course Description
Thermodynamics is a cornerstone of chemical engineering, providing the essential tools to determine the feasibility of a process. The concepts covered are fundamental to subsequent courses such as kinetics, separations, mass transfer, and design. This course reviews the first and second laws of thermodynamics, with a primary emphasis on the **nonideal properties** of single-component and multicomponent systems. A major portion of the course is devoted to **phase equilibrium**, which is critical for separations like distillation and extraction, and **chemical equilibrium**, which is essential for reactor design.

### Student Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
