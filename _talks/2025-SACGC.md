Natural gas is a key component of the global energy system, in which fossil fuels account for 81% of total energy consumption. Formed over millions of years, natural gas requires significant processing after extraction, including sweetening to remove hydrogen sulfide, dehydration to remove water, and distillation to separate its hydrocarbon components. In the global market, Russia, Iran, and Qatar hold the largest proven reserves, while the biggest importers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are located in Southeast Asia, led by China and Japan.
